# Google Search Console Indexing Checklist
## Oceanex Marine Industries

### 📋 PRIORITY PAGES TO INDEX

#### **TIER 1 - CRITICAL (Request Indexing First)**
1. ✅ **Homepage**
   - URL: `https://oceanexmarine.com/`
   - Why: Main entry point, highest traffic potential
   - Keywords: Indonesian seafood supplier, seafood exporter

2. ✅ **Product Catalog Page**
   - URL: `https://oceanexmarine.com/product/`
   - Why: Main product landing page, high commercial intent
   - Keywords: frozen tuna supplier, Indonesian seafood products

3. ✅ **About Page**
   - URL: `https://oceanexmarine.com/about`
   - Why: Company credibility, E-A-T signals
   - Keywords: about oceanex marine, seafood company indonesia

#### **TIER 2 - IMPORTANT (Request After Tier 1)**
4. ✅ **Sitemap**
   - URL: `https://oceanexmarine.com/sitemap.xml`
   - Why: Helps Google discover all pages automatically

5. ✅ **Robots.txt**
   - URL: `https://oceanexmarine.com/robots.txt`

#### **TIER 3 - SUPPORTING PAGES**
6. ⏳ **News/Blog Pages** (when you add content)
   - URL: `https://oceanexmarine.com/news.html`
   - Why: Fresh content signals, industry authority

### 🌍 INTERNATIONAL VERSIONS (If Using Subdomains/Subdirectories)
If you implement separate pages per language:
- `https://oceanexmarine.com/?lang=id` (Indonesian)
- `https://oceanexmarine.com/?lang=zh` (Chinese)
- `https://oceanexmarine.com/?lang=ja` (Japanese)

**Note:** Since you're using client-side translation (not separate URLs), you DON'T need to index language variations separately.

### 📱 SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

#### **Mobile-First Indexing**
- ✅ Already optimized - your site is responsive
- No separate mobile URLs needed

#### **Dynamic Content**
- Product specifications (opened via JS) are in HTML, so they're crawlable ✅
- Floating assistant widget is non-essential, fine to be JS-based ✅
